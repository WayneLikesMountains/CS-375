The website that I chose is the [Fish Aquarium](https://webglsamples.org/aquarium/aquarium.html) by Greggman and Human Engines. 
I originally selected this example because it was the first one. 
Another reason is because it looked more interesting compared to the other top results. 
I like that it is made with 3D models and that it is running in my web browser.
In this example, you are able to have a maximum of 3,000 fish at the same time.
The view can also be changed. One view is within the aquarium and the other view is outside of it looking in.
Lastly, there is a options section with many sliders to edit settings of the example such as the fishes speed and which particular direction the camera is looking in.
